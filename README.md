# Wireless MOTION REPLICATING MODULE

Concept and presentation materials for a motion-controlled module that replicates an operator’s motion (head/hand orientation) onto a remote platform (camera mount / payload) for use in unsafe or hard-to-reach environments.

IMPORTANT: No runnable code in this repository. This repo contains the idea, system architecture, and presentation/abstract PDFs. A working demo requires dedicated hardware.
